# environment
Repo to save the configurations of the different environment.

## Installation

### Directory
Inside of each directory, there's a script to install the config. Just run it and follow the instructions if needed.

### Theme
It is possible that the dark color of debian won't be applied properly.  
What worked for me is to force the appearance of legacy apps to 'Adawaita-dark' in Gnome Tweaks.
